Because HTML can't be parsed by regex.<br />
Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML.<br />
As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML.<br />
Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML.<br />
HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions.<br />
Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me.<br />
Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML.<br />
You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions.<br />
Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions.<br />
Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp.<br />
Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living.<br />
HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide.<br />
The cannot hold it is too late.<br />
 The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty.<br />
If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil<br />
for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes.<br />
HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.<br />
Rege̿̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved<br />
the trangession of a chi͡ld ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as previously prophesied)<br />
dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture<br />
and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world<br />
and the dread realm of c͒ͪo͛ͫrrupt entities (like SGML entities, but more corrupt)<br />
a mere glimpse of the world of reg​ex parsers for HTML will ins​tantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming,<br />
